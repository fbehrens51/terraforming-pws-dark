            Losing the BOSH Director does not significantly impact the experience of Tanzu Application Service end users. However, this issue means a loss of resiliency for BOSH-managed VMs.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            SSH into the `bosh-health-exporter` VM in the "Healthwatch Exporter" deployment, and view logs to find out why the BOSH Director is failing.

            App Smoke Tests run every 5-minutes. When running HA, multiple smoke tests may run in the given 5-minutes. These tests are intended to give Platform Operators confidence that Application Developers can successfully interact with and manage applications on the platform.
            Note: smoke tests will report a failure if any task (e.g. `push`, `login`) takes more than 5 minutes to complete.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            If a failure occurs, attempt to use the failed CLI command in a terminal to see why it is failing.

            Low memory can prevent app scaling and new deployments. The overall sum of capacity can indicate that you need to scale the platform. It is recommended that you have enough memory available to suffer a possible failure of an entire availability zone (AZ). If following the best practice guidance of three AZs, your % available memory should always be at least 35%.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            Assign more resources to the cells or assign more cells by scaling Diego cells in the Resource Config pane of the Tanzu Application Service tile.

            Tanzu Application Service components that use system databases include the Cloud Controller, Diego Brain, Gorouter, and the User Authorization and Authentication (UAA) server.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            Run mysql-diag and check the MySQL Server logs for errors.

          description: |
            High CPU utilization of the Gorouter VMs can increase latency and cause throughput, or requests per/second, to level-off. It is recommended to keep the CPU utilization within a maximum range of 60-70% for best Gorouter performance.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            Resolve high utilization by scaling the Gorouters horizontally, or vertically by editing the Router VM in the Resource Config pane of the Tanzu Application Service tile.

            The Tanzu Application Service Router on index ({{ $labels.index }}) has exceeded 90,000 file descriptors over the past 5 minutes.

            File Descriptors are an indication of an impending issue with the GoRouter. Each incoming request to the router consumes 2 file descriptors. Without the proper mitigations, it could be possible for an unresponsive application to eventually exhaust the file descriptors in GoRouter, starving routes from other applications running on Tanzu Application Service.

            Troubleshooting steps:
            (1) Identify which app(s) are requesting excessive connections and resolve the impacting issues with these applications.
            (2) If above recommended mitigations have not already been taken, do so.
            (3) Consider adding more GoRouter VM resources to increase total available file descriptors.

            If UAA is down, developers and operators cannot authenticate to access the platform.

            Troubleshooting steps:
            - Scale the UAA VMs in BOSH
            - See the [UAA Documentation](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/concepts/architecture/uaa.html) for more details and troubleshooting ideas.
  # APPLY THIS IF THE USAGE SERVICE IS DESIRED/INSTALLED

          summary: "Usage Service has failed to fetch Events from Cloud Controller (CAPI) for the last 48 hours for the deployment ({{ $labels.deployment }}."
          description: |
            This is typically caused when Usage Service is running correctly, but can't reach CAPI. Common issues are Usage Service can not authenticate, Cloud Controller is in a bad state or the network settings are incorrectly set up.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            - Check CAPI - Try `cf curl /v2/app_usage_events`. The response should be 200 with recent events as the payload.
            - Check UAA - Make sure the Usage Service can authenticate with CAPI.
            - Check the network settings.

            * If the Usage Service fails to fetch events for 7 or more days, reach out to support.
            **Data loss can occur if the Usage Service fails to fetch events for more than 29 days. **

          summary: "Usage Service Event Fetching is failing for the deployment ({{ $labels.deployment }}."
          description: |
            Typically, this means the Usage Service is healthy, but CAPI is not returning the information that is being requested. Historically, this has happened either due to network failures, or the UAA component not authenticating the Usage Service application successfully.

            Troubleshooting steps:
            - Check to see if you are able to query CAPI for /v2/app_usage_events and /v2/service_usage_events using the `cf curl` command. A failure would indicate there is a problem outside of the Usage Service application affecting the health of the foundation.
            - Check to see if UAA is working correctly.

            * If the Usage Service Event Fetching is failing for more than 7 days, reach out to support immediately.
            **Data loss can occur if Event Fetching fails for more than 29 days.**
