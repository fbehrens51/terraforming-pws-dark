2. ssh to ops_manager
3. connect to mysql: mysql -u admin -h <HOST> -p
Run the following mysql commands:

select * from networkpolicyserver.gorp_migrations order by applied_at;

if the last row has an id == 66, there is no work to do, proceed with the deployment.
if the last row has an id == 65; then insert a row with the following command:

insert into networkpolicyserver.gorp_migrations (id, applied_at) values ('66', now());

Run the select again to verify and exit mysql, log off ops manager, and proceed with the deployment.
