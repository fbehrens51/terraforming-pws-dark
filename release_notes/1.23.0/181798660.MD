1. ENABLE ERRANDS for the first deployment of the csb tile.
2. configure-asgs MUST run prior to the deployment of the csb-tile (only mentioned for troubleshooting support).
3. Create csb-config in <ENV>-foundation and copy the terragrunt.hcl from scs-config
4. Ensure the dependencies match the following

asg layer
```
dependencies {
  paths = ["../csb-config", "../scs-config"]
}
```

scs-config and csb-config layer
```
dependencies {
  paths = ["../pas"]
}
```
