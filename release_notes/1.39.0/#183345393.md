There is no mechanism to automatically delete the dashboard alerts that were migrated to alerting_rules.yml that are set in the tile configuration.
The following steps must be performed manually after HW 2.2.4 and the updated dashboards are delivered.
1. Login to grafana: https://grafana.pcfeagleci.cf-app.com/alerting/list
2. Open each alert rule and delete them.
