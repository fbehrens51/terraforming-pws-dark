# Installing Loki

## Prereqs

Generate two certs:

1. Loki's server cert with DNS SAN (loki.<root_romain>) e.g. `loki.pcfeagle.cf-app.com`
2. Loki's client cert

Place them in the secrets bucket.
Also place the issuer certificate authority for the loki client cert in the s3 bucket.

Add the following variable to the paperwork prereqs.tfvars

```
loki_config = {
  loki_role_name = ""
  loki_client_cert_signer_ca_cert_s3_path = ""
  loki_client_cert_s3_path = ""
  loki_client_key_s3_path = ""
  loki_server_cert_s3_path = ""
  loki_server_key_s3_path = ""
}
```

Loki's IAM role requires only "s3:*" and "ec2:CreateTags".

The other variables are certificates for loki communication.

`loki_client_cert_signer_ca_cert` will be used to validate `loki_client_cert` and `loki_client_key`
`loki_client_cert` and `loki_client_key` are used by fluentd to write and grafana to read from loki
`loki_server_cert` and `loki_server_key` are used by loki for TLS

## Feature Flag

Set `enable_loki = true` in the shared environment `terraform.tfvars`, e.g. `live/staging/terraform.tfvars`

This will result in changes in the following layers, which you can apply manually or let the pipeline handle:

- paperwork (to read the certificates and publish as outputs)
- bind (to add the loki.<root_domain> CNAME)
- fluentd (to start forwarding logs to loki)
- healthwatch-config (to start scraping loki's metrics endpoint)
- grafana-config (to populate the loki datasource and dashboard)

## Bootstrapping

Add and apply the `bootstrap_loki` layer to your environment. No special inputs
are required.

This will create enis, an NLB, persistent EBS volumes, etc.

## Deploying

Add and apply the `loki` layer to your environment. If applying interactively,
you will need to specify the path to the loki bundle, which should have been
populated by the pipeline into the public bucket. `loki-2.3.0.zip` for example.
You can optionally set the `retention_period` to some number of hours (>24).
Default is `1440h` (60 days). Loki will delete logs older than this period.
