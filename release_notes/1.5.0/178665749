# Installing Loki

## Prereqs

Add the following variables to the paperwork prereqs.tfvars

```
loki_role_name = ""
loki_client_cert_signer_ca_cert_s3_path = ""
loki_client_cert_s3_path = ""
loki_client_key_s3_path = ""
loki_server_cert_s3_path = ""
loki_server_key_s3_path = ""
```

Loki's IAM role requires only "s3:*" and "ec2:CreateTags".

The other variables are certificates for loki communication.

`loki_client_cert_signer_ca_cert` will be used to validate `loki_client_cert` and `loki_client_key`
`loki_client_cert` and `loki_client_key` are used by fluentd to write and grafana to read from loki
`loki_server_cert` and `loki_server_key` are served by loki for TLS, and should have the DNS SAN `loki.<root_domain>`. e.g. `loki.pcfeagle.cf-app.com`

## Bootstrapping

Add and apply the `bootstrap_loki` layer to your environment. No special inputs are required.

This will create enis, an NLB, persistent EBS volumes, etc.

## Deploying

Add and apply the `loki` layer to your environment. If applying interactively, you will need to specify the path to the loki bundle, which should have been populated by the pipeline into the public bucket. `loki-2.3.0.zip` for example.
You can optionally set the `retention_period` to some number of hours (>24). Default is `1440h` (60 days).
After this time, loki will delete logs.
