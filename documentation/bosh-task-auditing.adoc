Some of these logs should be available via splunk

=== The following will be forwarded to Splunk via OpsManager syslog forwarding

==== Ops manager API calls

* /var/log/opsmanager/audit_log.txt (json)
** sent when log rolls over at midnight and all records wind up with 12:01 timestamp according to splunk, but the real timestamp is embedded within the body of the log message.

** e.g. search in Splunk to see who did a deployment
*** "fritz99" AND "deploy" host="10.2.229.12"
** e.g. search in Splunk for a particular task
*** "31575" host="10.2.229.12"

==== Opsmanager ssh

* /var/log/auth.log
** e.g. search in Splunk
*** "Accepted publickey for ubuntu from 10.1.0.228"
